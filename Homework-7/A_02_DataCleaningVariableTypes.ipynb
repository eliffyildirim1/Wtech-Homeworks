Consider the example of age. Although possible different values of age are finite, in some cases it makes more sense to assess age as a continuous variable. So, some variables can be both discrete and continuous. We can give an example of age for continuous data type. They can be categorized as young, middle, elderly, or whether they are younger or older than 18."
